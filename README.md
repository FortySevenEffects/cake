C++ AVR Kernel & Extensions

## Hardware Abstraction Layers for AVR processors

This library exposes some template classes and utilities for interfacing AVR hardware features efficiently.

It may result in more code to type and a good headache if templates are not your thing,
but the avr-gcc compiler seems to love this kind of stuff.

Inspired by Emilie Gillet's [pichenettes/avril](https://github.com/pichenettes/avril) library.
